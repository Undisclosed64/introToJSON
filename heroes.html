    /*Obtaining the JSON
To obtain the JSON, we use an API called XMLHttpRequest (often called XHR). This is a very useful JavaScript object that allows us to make network requests to retrieve resources from a server via JavaScript (e.g. images, text, JSON, even HTML snippets.

1)To start with, we store the URL of the JSON we want to retrieve in a variable. Add the following at the bottom of your JavaScript code:
let requestURL = 'https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json.

2)To create a request, we need to create a new request object instance from the XMLHttpRequest constructor, using the new keyword. Add the following below your last line:
let request = new XMLHttpRequest();

3)Now we need to open the request using the open() method. Add the following line:
request.open('GET', requestURL);
This takes at least two parameters — there are other optional parameters available. We only need the two mandatory ones for this simple example:
The HTTP method to use when making the network request. In this case GET is fine, as we are just retrieving some simple data.
The URL to make the request to — this is the URL of the JSON file that we stored earlier.

4)Next, add the following two lines — here we are setting the responseType to JSON, so that XHR knows that the server will be returning JSON, and that this should be converted behind the scenes into a JavaScript object. Then we send the request with the send() method:
request.responseType = 'json';
request.send();

5)The last bit of this section involves waiting for the response to return from the server, then dealing with it. Add the following code below your previous code:
request.onload = function() {
  const superHeroes = request.response;
  populateHeader(superHeroes);
  showHeroes(superHeroes);
}
Here we are storing the response to our request (available in the response property) in a variable called superHeroes; this variable now contains the JavaScript object based on the JSON! We are then passing that object to two function calls — the first one fills the <header> with the correct data, while the second one creates an information card for each hero on the team, and inserts it into the <section>.
  then we write the functions.*/
